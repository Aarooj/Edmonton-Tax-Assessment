# Edmonton Tax Assessment

##### Notebook 1: EDA

# Data Processing, Mining, and Visualization 

## Introduction

The primary dataset for this project is the Edmonton Property Tax Assessment data from 2016, which offers a rich playground for our analysis. Additionally, I integrated census data from the same year to deepen our insights. These files are from the [Edmonton Data Portal](https://data.edmonton.ca/) 

### Scope of the Project

Throughout this notebook, I employed various data processing techniques to manipulate and understand the data. The tasks include loading the data, filtering specific categories, sorting, and identifying key patterns. Moreover, I delved into data visualization, creating histograms, scatterplots, and boxplots. These visualizations not only aided me in understanding the data better but also in spotting trends and outliers.

### Integration with Census Data

A significant part of this project involves merging the tax assessment data with relevant census data. This allows us to explore correlations between property values and demographic variables, offering a more holistic view of the data. I also engineer new features from the combined dataset to uncover deeper insights.

### Advanced Analysis

I also engaged in advanced analytical techniques like clustering (K-Means), dimensionality reduction (PCA), and analyzing the results of these methods. 


##### Notebook 2: ML Pipeline

## Introduction to Machine Learning Pipelines
I designed this project to predict the actual property assessments.

I employed various techniques and tools to construct a comprehensive pipeline that processes data, selects features, optimizes hyperparameters, and evaluates model performance based on specific criteria.
